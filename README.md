## react-native-bluetooth-io

React native bridge module for Bluetooth to enable Android and iOS to
communicate with embedded Bluetooth devices.

## Project Status
1. Android ( In progress )
2. iOS ( not started - will be based on EADemo example )

## Project Goals
1. Support RFCOMM, also known as the Serial Port Profile ( SPP ).
2. Consider adding GPS NMEA parsing support or starting a new project
that builds on this project.

Example projects I used to learn from:
- https://github.com/EstebanFuentealba/react-native-share
- https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons
- https://github.com/yamill/react-native-orientation
- https://github.com/lwansbrough/react-native-camera

Next time, start with react-native-create-library that creates Android, iOS, and
Windows projects:
